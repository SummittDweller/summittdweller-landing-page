# summittdweller-landing-page

This project defines the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)-generated landing page for [summittdweller.com](https://summittdweller.com/).

# Deploying This Site

This site is deployed via [DigitalOcean App Platform](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/), which is connected directly to this GitHub repository. There is no manual deployment step:

1. Commit and push changes to the `main` branch of this repo.
2. App Platform detects the push, clones the repo (including the `themes/bootstrap-bp-hugo-startpage` git submodule), builds the site with its Hugo buildpack, and serves the static output at [summittdweller.com](https://summittdweller.com/).

Note that the `baseURL` is intentionally commented out in `config.toml` so that App Platform can serve the site from whatever URL it assigns.

# Updating This Site

The process of adding a site, or making any addition/change, to this page is now very simple:

```
cd ~/GitHub/summittdweller-landing-page
# ...edit content, config.toml, etc...
git add -A
git commit -m "Describe your change"
git push
```

App Platform *automagically* takes care of the rest!

# Analytics

The portal uses a separate GA4 property from the personal blog. Its Web stream
is `SummittDweller.com portal production website` for
`https://summittdweller.com`, with Measurement ID `G-3QPKBWP768` and stream ID
`16297878071`.

`config.toml` sets the ID under `[services.googleAnalytics]`.
`layouts/partials/head.html` emits Hugo's built-in GA4 template only in
production; `layouts/partials/js.html` does not emit a second tracker.
The Matomo site 7 snippet and obsolete Universal Analytics setting have been
removed. Do not reuse the personal blog's ID or install another Google tag.

Plain `hugo` builds are production builds. `hugo server` and builds using
`--environment development` omit analytics. Review applicable privacy and
consent requirements before publishing.

After deployment, reload the live portal and check the portal property's
Realtime report. Browser blocking can prevent visits from appearing.
The "Site Analytics" panel remains a placeholder: installing the tracker
does not automatically populate it with a public report.

# Legacy Docker Deployment (Retired)

This site was previously deployed as a Docker image (`summittdweller/summittdweller-landing`, later `mcfatem/summittdweller-landing`) pushed to Docker Hub and run on a DigitalOcean Docker droplet behind Traefik, with Watchtower auto-pulling new `:latest` images. That workflow is retired; its artifacts (`Dockerfile`, `push-update.sh`, etc.) have been preserved in the `.out-of-the-way/` directory for reference.
